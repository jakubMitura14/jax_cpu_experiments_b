r"""Example training script for training OGB molhiv with jax graph-nets & flax.

The ogbg-molhiv dataset is a molecular property prediction dataset.
It is adopted from the MoleculeNet [1]. All the molecules are pre-processed
using RDKit [2].

Each graph represents a molecule, where nodes are atoms, and edges are chemical
bonds. Input node features are 9-dimensional, containing atomic number and
chirality, as well as other additional atom features such as formal charge and
whether the atom is in the ring or not.

The goal is to predict whether a molecule inhibits HIV virus replication or not.
Performance is measured in ROC-AUC.

This script uses a GraphNet to learn the prediction task.
