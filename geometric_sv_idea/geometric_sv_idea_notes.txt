We can get how much sv is in the triangle by evaluating its corners weather they are in the given sv
Each control point will be represented as entry in the 4 channel ( for 2d)  in the learned array we will establish its location like it would be attached by 4 springs and each channel will tell the force of a spring ... additionally we can add some forces to the neighbouring controll points to avoid some crazy shapes - we basically want convex svs
Now is a given point or corner of a pixel in sv we can run algorithm checking is it in given polygon ; for corners we would like to binarize it to yes or no then the sv can be softly  evaluated at least potentially... 
We can also establish is any of the lines (or planes in 3d) is intersecting given sv borders if so we can add there some partial - soft ownership between neighbouring svs 
It would be nice if we could just get the raised to some power deviation of the sum of subtriangles area to triangle area (the same for tetrahedron) as a measurement of how much the point is inside , we can in theory at least make it more stable adding some small perturbations  ; in order to check multiple triangles we would just multiply deviations a single 0 deviation would lead to 0 total deviation
We do not need springs we can just get the dot product of a vector with given direction in x y axis and multiply by its strength value
