In docs was stated that we can add weights to points - we can use it for masking purposes
1) get sinkhorn barycenters weighted by image mask as the sv description
2) get ot transport cost between those barycenters - as they are sth like image histograms

!!! understend better barycenters maybe they can be used directly for clustering 


Below example how to get cost from 2 point clouds
